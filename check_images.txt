Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, the classifications for Dog_01.jpg were different. AlexNet classified it incorrectly, while ResNet and VGG correctly identified the breed.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, the classifications differed. AlexNet did not match the breed of Dog_01.jpg with Dog_02.jpg, while both ResNet and VGG classified both images correctly.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all three models correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg as not being dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I selected VGG and ResNet as the best model architectures because both achieved perfect accuracy in classifying all images, including the correct identification of dog breeds, without any misclassifications.
